```

You can then move it anywhere in your path:

```console
$ mv deis /usr/local/bin
```

### From Scratch

To compile the client from scratch, ensure you have Docker installed and run

	$ make bootstrap
	$ make build

`make bootstrap` will fetch all required dependencies, while `make build` will compile and install
the client in the current directory.

	$ ./deis --version

## Usage

Running `deis help` will give you a up to date list of `deis` commands.
To learn more about a command run `deis help <command>`.

## Windows Support

`deis` has experimental support for Windows. To build deis for Windows, you need to install
[go](https://golang.org/) and [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide). Then run the `make.bat` script.
